## My process
​
### Built with
​
- Node.js
- MySQL
- Express & sequelize
- Handlebars

### What I learned

This was a little intense of a challenge with the file size number and the introduction of handlebars. I learned a bit too late on how to implement the view files correctly and it will show. This is amazing though now that I understand what can be done and the use of template and partials to dramatically change just certain parts of the display/view.
​
### Continued development
​
I still have so much to do and it will take awhile to recover from the damage I did early on before handlebars clicked a little bit more. What I will do next is finish up the handlebars and make sure the routes target them correcly. I made files that were missing that I am certain will be used. I was able to get some help from the TA's on some early issues but I did not work on getting the view section to work until the weekend before it was due and couldnt not figure it untill the last second.
​
### Useful resources
​
- [resource 1](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/session.html) - needed this for setting up the session and cookie section
- [resource 2](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/core-concepts/model-basics/#timestamps) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [resource 2](https://codingstatus.com/how-to-update-data-using-node-js-and-mysql/) - Gave some good ideas for updating but doesn't quite do it the way we were taught.

## Acknowledgments
​
I would like to thank the instructor and the TAs for helping out. I was stuck a few times and the office hours definitely helped but it was before I tried to get the view section to work and could not progress any further because of that.
